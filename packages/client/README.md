# Client

The `client` package represents the actual game client, which is a Next.js application.

## Getting Started

The client leverages all other packages, which must be built before the client can run. This can be done using the `yarn build:systems` package script.

Once the rest of the monorepo's packages have been built, the client can be run for local development with the `yarn dev:client` package script.
